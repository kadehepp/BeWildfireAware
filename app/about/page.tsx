    <p>BeWildfireAware gathers data from Remote Automated Weather Stations (RAWS) from around the dispatch areas, through WIMS, then takes the current Fire Danger Operating Plan (FDOP) to calculate the Fire Danger Rating, ERC and BI percentile and pocket cards. The Fire Danger Rating Areas (FDRA) come directly from the FDOP. This service allows for easy access to forecasted NFDRS data.</p>
    <p>We welcome comments and suggestions about the BeWildfireAware (BWA) website, so we can continue to improve the site and applications. BWA strives to provide information to fire professionals and other agencies that could be effective by Wildfires. The BWA is just one of many tools that are available to help share information about wildfires.</p>
